The reasoning behind this project was to make the current web page more accessible and help the code flow along more smoothly

In order to do this, I had to move around some of the header/footer code and rename some of the existing divs with semantic html elements.
I fixed one issue where clicking "SEO" in the search bar wasn't redirecting to the proper place on the page by changing the ID.
I indented and re-ordered the elements to follow a logical pattern.
I added alternate attributes to the images.

Overall, I learned that having semantic elements and clean code makes things a lot easier to edit/fix if I needed to go back in the future.
Without altering these elements, it would be impossible to know exactly what was supposed to go where.

I didn't add any new features to the original page but there are a lot of edits that I would like to make in the future.
